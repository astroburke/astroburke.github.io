Have you wondered what the theoretical maximum image size is for a jpeg?

Well, the answer is a 4 GiB, or 4.295 GB memory footprint (real sizes will be smaller due to compression). Assuming a 16:9 image ratio and a multiplier of 4 for RGBA color encoding, the maximum jpg you could have is 43688 by 24576 pixels. That's 40K resolution!

Now what if I could render a screenshot of a scene from one of my favorite planetarium programs, Space Engine, at that resolution?
