I am a second year master's student at Stony Brook University.

I have broad research interests across astronomy with direct experience in [Kinematic Weak Lensing](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013arXiv1311.1489H/abstract) and automated redshift fitting. I've worked with datasets such as Keck DEIMOS and Gaia DR3.

I am currently working toward my master's thesis on my automated redshift fitting program.
